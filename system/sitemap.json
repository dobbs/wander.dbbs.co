David Woods. 2011. Three ways adaptive systems fail: (1) decompensation—exhaust capacity to adapt as challenges cascade; (2) work at cross-purposes—locally adaptive behaviour is globally mal-adaptive; and (3) getting stuck in outdated behaviours—over-reliance on past successes. A working organisation need abilities to detect these three adaptive traps as they approach and needs abilities to act to avoid or escape them. Detecting these traps requires contrasting diverse perspectives.
