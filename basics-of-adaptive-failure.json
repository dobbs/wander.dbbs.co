            "text": "Basic patterns in how adaptive systems fail. David Woods. 2011. This chapter provides three basic patterns in how adaptive systems fail: (1) decompensation – exhausts its capacity to adapt as challenges cascade; (2) working at cross-purposes – when behaviour is locally adaptive but globally mal-adaptive; and (3) getting stuck in outdated behaviours – over-reliance on past successes. Illustrations are drawn from urban fire-fighting and crisis management. A working organisation needs to be able to see and avoid or recognise and escape when the system is moving toward one of the three basic adaptive traps. Understanding how adaptive systems can fail requires contrasting diverse perspectives. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284324002_Basic_patterns_in_how_adaptive_systems_fail researchgate]"
