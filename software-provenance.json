As a result, given guidance by the group creating the software, in-toto allows the user to verify if a step in the supply chain was intended to be performed, if the step was performed by the right actor, and attests that materials (e.g., source code) were not tampered with between steps. [https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/v0.9/in-toto-spec.md github]"
