In Crosscut you sketch, cobble, tinker, and play toward a deeper understanding. Begin by using the drawing tools to sketch something you’re thinking about, as you would with pen & paper. Then, add dynamic behaviors with a programming system that lives right inside your sketches. Each dynamic sketch is a reusable part that you can nest inside other sketches, enabling you to build elaborate models from simple pieces. Ink & Switch.
